**Formal Pseudocode**

Although the paper does not introduce a brand-new model architecture, it significantly modifies the approach to training AI modelsâ€”particularly in terms of how they are supervised and how they learn to handle harmful content autonomously

**Code**:

# Initialize parameters for CAI Model based on pre-trained RLHF Model

# Define Constitutional Principles
constitutional_principles = {Principle_1, Principle_2, ..., Principle_N}

for each training iteration:
    for each prompt in training dataset do:
        1. Generate initial response using CAI Model
        2. Critique response based on a randomly selected principle from Set of Principles
        3. Revise response based on critique
        4. Update CAI Model with revised response

        if reinforcement learning phase then:
            1. Generate pair of responses for each harmful prompt
            2. Evaluate pairs using AI-generated feedback model:
                1. Choose principle for evaluation
                2. Calculate probabilities for each response being less harmful
            3. Update preference model with new evaluations
            4. Fine-tune CAI Model using updated preference model as reward signal

# Evaluate model performance on validation set
if performance improves then
    Save current model
else
    Reduce learning rate or revert to previous model

Return trained CAI Model
