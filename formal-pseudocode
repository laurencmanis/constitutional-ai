Formal Pseudocode
Although the paper does not introduce a brand-new model architecture, it significantly modifies the approach to training AI modelsâ€”particularly in terms of how they are supervised and how they learn to handle harmful content autonomously

# Initialize parameters for CAI Model based on pre-trained RLHF Model

# Define Constitutional Principles
constitutional_principles = {Principle_1, Principle_2, ..., Principle_N}

# Supervised Learning Phase 
for each training epoch:
    for each prompt in training dataset:
        for each iteration from 1:4:
            1. Generate initial response using CAI Model
            2. Randomly selecrt a principle 
            3. Critique response based on a randomly selected principle 
            4. Revise response based on critique
            5. Update CAI Model with revised response

# Reinforcement Learning Pahse 
for each training epoch:
    for each prompt in training dataset:
        1. Generate pair of responses for each harmful prompt
        2. Evaluate pairs using AI-generated feedback model:
            1. Choose principle for evaluation
            2. Calculate probabilities for each response being less harmful
        3. Update preference model with new evaluations
        4. Fine-tune CAI Model using updated preference model as reward signal

# Evaluate model performance on validation set
if performance improves then
    Save current model
else
    Reduce learning rate or revert to previous model

Return trained CAI Model
